                    <p><i><b>Internet</b></i> is a global communication system that links together thousands of individual networks. It allows exchange of information between two or more computers on a network.</p>
                    <p>The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that allows users to access and share information and devices, allowing them to communicate and exchange data. It enables users to access a wide range of services, such as websites, emails, social media, online applications, and cloud storage.</p>

            <p>IP Address stands for Internet Protocol Address. Every computer or device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address, provided by Internet Service Providers (ISPs).</p>

        <li>
            <p> <p>An IP address is a set of four numbers like 192.154.3.29, where each number ranges from 0 to 255, making the full range from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255. It plays a key role in the flow of data over the Internet.</p>

                    <p>IPv6 addresses were created to deal with the shortage of IPv4 addresses. They use 128 bits instead of 32, offering a vastly greater number of possible addresses. These addresses are expressed as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits. The groups are separated by colons.</p>

                    <p>A DNS server acts as the "phonebook for the internet," translating human-friendly domain names (like "google.com") into machine-readable IP addresses (like 172.217.160.142) so your device can find the correct website or service online. When you type a URL into your browser, a DNS query is sent to a DNS server, which then locates the corresponding IP address and sends it back, allowing your browser to connect to the server hosting the website. This process, known as DNS resolution,    essential for the internet to function, enabling you to access online content without needing to memorize complex IP addresses.  </p>

                    <p>A <b>Router</b> serves as the hub where the majority of LANs connect to the Internet. Home LANs often utilise a single router, but bigger LANs may also use network switches to transmit packets more effectively.</p>
